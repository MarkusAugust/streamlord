[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- `streamlord-core`: `ElementsGuard`, the `$` trap hunted in HTML written as a string. It walks
  the tags, finds every `data-*` attribute whose value is an expression and runs it through
  `ExpressionGuard`; the exception names the attribute. `Streamlord(guardElements = true)`
  applies it to every element patch and elements response that leaves through that instance:
  streams, `encode(flow)`, Ktor's `respondDatastar(response)`, Spring's `datastarElements` and
  `asServerSentEvents`. Off by default. The Ktor plugin takes it as
  `install(StreamlordPlugin) { guardElements = true }`. The same guard catches a mistyped
  attribute: a `data-*` name one letter away from a Datastar attribute (`data-onn:click`,
  `data-signal:x`) throws `MistypedAttributeException` naming the attribute it resembles,
  while names further away are taken to be your own and left alone. A bare name without key
  or modifier is only judged against Datastar names of six letters or more, so `data-test`,
  `data-kind` and `data-once` pass. `<script>` and `<style>` bodies are skipped.
  `ElementsGuard.attributes` lists every Datastar attribute name, bound to the catalog by test.
- `ExpressionGuard` accepts `[]`, `{}`, spread (`...$items`) and leading-dot decimals (`.5`),
  which it refused before as operator-only or dangling.
- `catalog/datastar-1.0.4.json`: `keyCase` on every keyed attribute (`camel`, `kebab` or
  `raw`), the one place the casing rule is written; the catalog test binds `Casing` to it and
  the extension reads it.
- `@Language("HTML")`, `@Language("JSON")` and `@Language("JavaScript")` on every `elements`,
  `signals` and `script` parameter in core, Ktor and Spring, so IntelliJ injects the right
  language into a literal passed straight in. The annotation comes with the Kotlin standard
  library; no new dependency.
- README: "Three ways to write markup", covering the DSL, strings (`$$"""..."""`,
  `@Language("HTML")`) and templates as equals, with what each gets from the SDK and the editors.
- `streamlord-html`: `Casing`, the casing rules of Datastar applied so that the name you write
  is the name you get. The browser lowercases attribute names, so the keyed helpers write a
  camelCase name as the kebab-case key Datastar reads back as that name (`dataSignals("fooBar")`
  is `data-signals:foo-bar`, the signal `$fooBar`), adding `__case.camel` for `dataOn` and
  `dataClass` where Datastar's default is kebab, and `__case.pascal` for a leading capital.
  `dataAttr`, `dataStyle` and `dataAnimate` write the key in kebab-case. `signal()` and the
  other expression helpers read a kebab-case key the way Datastar names it (`signal("foo-bar")`
  is `$fooBar`). `InvalidSignalNameException` for a blank name or one with whitespace, quotes
  or a character that ends an attribute; `hover:bg-red-500`, `xlink:href`, `--brand` and
  `items[0].name` are fine. An explicit `case =` is kept, with the key still in kebab-case.

### Changed

- `ExpressionGuard` and `InterpolatedExpressionException` moved from `streamlord-html` to
  `streamlord-core` (`io.github.markusaugust.streamlord.core.domain`), so the string and
  template paths can use them without the DSL. `InterpolatedExpressionException` gained an
  `attribute` property.
- `datastarElements`, `DatastarResponse.toResponseEntity` (Spring), `asServerSentEvents` and
  `DatastarEvent.toServerSentEvent` (Spring WebFlux) take an optional `streamlord` parameter,
  last, for the guard; Spring has no auto-configuration, so pass your bean. `Streamlord` gained the `guardElements`
  constructor parameter, also last. Kotlin callers recompile unchanged; Java callers of the
  full constructor pass one more argument.

### Deprecated

- The `streamlord-html` names `ExpressionGuard` and `InterpolatedExpressionException` remain as
  type aliases of the core ones.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `streamlord-html`: `ExpressionGuard` and `InterpolatedExpressionException`. Every expression
  helper in `streamlord-html` and `streamlord-html-pro` now refuses, at render time, text that
  has the shape a Kotlin string template leaves behind when it interpolates a signal
  (`"$count++"` arriving as `"++"`). The message names the helpers and the `$$"..."` literal.
- README: a section on the `$` trap and the three ways to avoid it.

### Fixed

- CI: the Maven Central publish job no longer fires on `vscode-v*` tags.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

The first forging.

### Added

- `editors/vscode`: the Streamlord VS Code extension (diagnostics, completions, hover,
  highlighting, Stream Inspector) and `catalog/datastar-1.0.4.json`, the shared source of
  truth verified by `CatalogTest`.

- `streamlord-core`: Datastar 1.0.4 protocol model (`PatchElements`, `PatchSignals`,
  `ExecuteScript`), `SseEncoder` verified against the official SDK golden files, non-SSE
  `DatastarResponse` types, a dependency-free strict JSON parser and writer, the
  `DatastarStream` driving port and the `SseSink`, `SignalsCodec` and `IncomingRequest`
  driven ports, and the `Streamlord` facade with bounded signal reading.
- `streamlord-html`: kotlinx.html DSL for every Datastar attribute, modifier, action and
  expression helper; `patchElements { }` for streams, events and responses.
- `streamlord-ktor`: `respondDatastar`, `respondElements`/`respondSignals`/`respondScript`,
  `readSignals`, the `StreamlordPlugin`, and an in-process run of the official SDK
  conformance server.
- `streamlord-spring`: `datastarStream` over `StreamingResponseBody`, `readSignals` over
  `HttpServletRequest`, `ResponseEntity` helpers, `Flow<DatastarEvent>.asServerSentEvents()`
  for WebFlux, and `ElementPatchModeConverter`.
- `streamlord-json-kotlinx`, `streamlord-json-jackson` (Jackson 3, Spring Boot 4) and
  `streamlord-json-jackson2` (Jackson 2, Spring Boot 3): codec adapters for typed signals.
- `streamlord-html`: `payload` and `responseOverrides` fetch options, `dataOnFetch` with
  `FetchEventType` constants, and `DatastarAttributes.prefix` for the aliased `data-star-*` bundle.
- `streamlord-html-pro`: opt-in helpers for the attribute names and actions of Datastar Pro,
  containing no Pro code. The Spring adapter is compiled against Spring Framework 6.2 and
  tested against 6.2 and 7.0.
